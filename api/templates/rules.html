                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Mǽrstánas is a free libre open source abstract strategy game where players alternate placing
                    stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points ("hinges") between
                    their own pieces or the edges of the board.
                </p>
                <h3>Objective</h3>
                <p>Players try to achieve the highest score by making the most number of connections.</p>
                <h3>Starting the game</h3>
                <p>The board begins empty (similar to Go). The player using the darker colored stones
                    goes first. Players then alternate taking turns.</p>
                <h2>Playing the game</h2>
                <p>On a player's turn, the player places one stone (<em>stán</em>) on a square on the game board.
                    Stones (<em>stánas</em>) must be placed within the square, not on the intersections as in Go. Stones
                    may be placed on any empty square, either standing alone or adjacent to another stone of either color
                    (creating a <em>heorr</em> or "hinge").
                </p>
                <h3>Placement limitations</h3>
                <p>
                    Stones may have no more than <strong>three</strong> hinges; the fourth side <em>must always
                    remain free</em>. Stones may not be placed such that four hinges are created immediately. The edge
                    of the board counts as <strong>one</strong> hinge; corners count as <strong>two</strong> because they
                    border two edges. Play continues until no more viable moves remain.
                </p>
                <h2>Scoring</h2>
                <p>
                    Players receive one point for each stone or edge that is adjacent to one of their own stones
                    (<em>freóndlíc heorr</em> or "friendly hinge"). The player with the highest score wins. Note
                    that tie games are possible.
                </p>
