            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Mǽrstánas is a free libre open source abstract strategy game
                where players alternate placing stones within the squares of a
                7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points ("hinges")
                between their own pieces or the edges of the board.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                Players try to achieve the highest score by making the most
                number of connections.
            </p>
            <h3>Starting the game</h3>
            <p>
                The board begins empty (similar to Go). The player using the
                darker colored stones goes first. Players then alternate taking
                turns.
            </p>
            <h2>Playing the game</h2>
            <p>
                On a player's turn, the player places one stone (<em>stán</em>)
                on a square on the game board. Stones (<em>stánas</em>) must be
                placed within the square, not on the intersections as in Go.
                Stones may be placed on any empty square, either standing alone
                or adjacent to another stone of either color (creating a <em>heorr</em>
                or "hinge").
            </p>
            <h3>Placement limitations</h3>
            <p>
                Stones may have no more than <strong>three</strong> hinges; the
                fourth side <em>must always remain free</em>. Stones may not be
                placed such that four hinges are created immediately. The edge
                of the board counts as <strong>one</strong> hinge; corners count
                as <strong>two</strong> because they border two edges. Play
                continues until no more viable moves remain.
            </p>
            <h3>Special Stones</h3>
            <p class="fw-light">(Available with version 0.4
                only)</p>
            <h4>Thunder-stone rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players each have <strong>one</strong> thunder-stone (<em>Þunor-stán</em>),
                    which may be placed on the board during their turn <strong>instead
                    of a regular stone</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Thunder-stones are the exception to the four hinge
                    limitation. This is because, when placed, a thunder-stone
                    removes any and all stones orthogonally adjacent to its
                    position, whether they belong to the player or the opponent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stones which have been removed from the board are returned
                    to the respective players and do not count as captures or
                    contribute to scoring in any way.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After placement, thunder-stones hinges and scoring are
                    treated the same as normal stones.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Woden-stone rules</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Players each have <strong>one</strong> Woden-stone (<em>wóden-stán</em>),
                    which may be placed on the board during their turn <strong>instead
                    of a regular stone</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Unlike standard and thunder-stones, which are placed on an
                    open square, players use the Woden-stone to
                    <strong>replace</strong> one of their opponent's stones
                    already on the board.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Being able to swap out an opponent's stone can create unique
                    scoring and blocking opportunities, so waiting to use the
                    Woden-stone until later in the game may offer greater
                    strategic advantage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After placement, Woden-stones are scored the same as normal
                    stones.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h2>Scoring</h2>
            <p>In all scoring methods, the player with the highest score wins.
                Note that tie games are possible.</p>
            <h3>Default Method</h3>
            <p>
                Players receive one point for each stone or edge that is
                adjacent to one of their own stones
                (<em>freóndlíc heorr</em> or "friendly hinge").
            </p>
            <h3>Simple Method</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Edges are not scored.</strong> Players only receive
                points for stones that are adjacent to one
                of their own stones.
            </p>
