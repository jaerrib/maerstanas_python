# maerstanas_python

## Overview
**Mǽrstánas** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game. Gameplay involves players alternately placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points between their own pieces. Scoring is based on the number of these connections. Its development is hosted on Codeberg at <https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/maerstanas>.

> Mǽrstánas means *boundary stones* in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).
