# maerstanas_python

## Overview

**[Mǽrstánas](https://jaerrib.codeberg.page/maerstanas/)** is a free libre open source abstract strategy game. Gameplay involves players alternately placing stones within the squares of a 7x7 grid with the goal of creating connection points between their own pieces. Scoring is based on the number of these connections.

Development happens on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jaerrib/maerstanas) with a mirror hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/jaerrib/maerstanas_python>).

> Mǽrstánas means *boundary stones* in Anglo-Saxon (Old English).

## Project goals

The original goals of this project were simple. I wanted to improve my ability to code in Python by building a game. Since then, **Mǽrstánas** has evolved from a terminal app to being implemented in Pygame. As I've gotten more involved with web development, I've rewritten the game as a Flask app, which is currently [playable on Fly.io](https://maerstanas-python.fly.dev/), and a Django version with multiplayer functionality is in the works.

As the Pygame version is no longer the focus, the branches of this repo are being reconfigured accordingly.

The new / current focus of this project is to:

- [ ] improve the responsiveness / speed of the game
- [ ] incorporate additional features based on more recent ruleset versions
- [ ] grow the player base and gain user feedback
- [ ] test out ideas to be incorporated into the Django version
